# Flow-Aware WPT k-Nearest Neighbours Regression for Short-Term Traffic Prediction
Choosing the right parameter values for kNN is problematic.
We propose weighted parameter tuples (WPT) to calculate weighted average dynamically according to flow rate.

# Usage of Code
(The code will be updated.)


# Results
The results show that flow-aware WPT kNN performs better than manually tuned kNN as well as benchmark methods such as extreme gradient boosting (XGB) and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA). 
Thus, it is recommended to use dynamic parameters regarding traffic flow and to consider all parameters at the same time.
